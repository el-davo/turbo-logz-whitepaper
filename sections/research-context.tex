\section{Research Context}

Log analysis can be a complex task. With the emergence of microservice architectures this task has become even more difficult. This is mainly due to the the distributed nature of microservices and the fact that they can be written in many languages and interact with each other in many new ways when compared to a monolithic architecture.
